            When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
            meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage
            of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
            sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
            stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants
            are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the
            stalks,

            The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The
            crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard
            now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham
            dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.

            The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out
            of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars. Over
            the rock-cut doorway of the inner chamber was hung an orris-root, and
            over that a laurel-leaf, a small branch of olive, and a little bunch of
            leaves from the white-horned thorn, and besides these, four garlands
            made by his wife, of various flowers, together with a broken knife,
            several pieces of ribbon, and some other small matters.
